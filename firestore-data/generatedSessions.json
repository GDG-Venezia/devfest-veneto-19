        "description": "All of us heard about this magical creature living in the product space called MVP. Or at least we've heard some manager babbling about it. In this talk, we'll discuss the key tech requirements of a Minimum Viable Product, from metrics drivers to fast delivery, in relation to what investors usually look for when evaluating a startup. We will then discover why native development, when viewed through the lens of cost-benefit ratio, is most of the time not the best tech-stack to choose if you're building a blitzscaling company from the group up – and why cross-platform frameworks like Flutter are. Finally, we'll go through technical debt as well and what it means if you're raising a new funding round, as it is the natural downside of not going native since day 0.",

To do this effectively, essential steps are understanding the event loop, basics of Futures and Streams, async/await, async* and yield keywords and learning about a number of helper classes. Furthermore, there are a number of common patterns that arise while creating asynchronous code that is interactive. In this talk, even if you never wrote asynchronous code before, you will understand the concept, the tools and the patterns that will be useful in your asynchronous programming journey. This should help you become a better Flutter developer. "

                "bio": "Sin dai primi anni di vita ho avuto a che fare con computer, sono cresciuto assieme alla tecnologia ed è diventata da subito la mia passione. Dopo il diploma di perito capotecnico informatico sono laureato in informatica a Padova. Prima di laurearmi entro in Uqido, dove lavoro tutt'ora. In Uqido sono entrato nel 2012 come primo dipendente come sviluppatore web e ho sviluppato un prodotto software per 3 anni, per poi iniziare a sviluppare e gestire piattaforme software per clienti. Sono cresciuto in questi sette anni assieme all’azienda, che ora conta 40 dipendenti e più di dieci progetti attivi. Il mio ruolo è diventato pian piano più manageriale che operativo, e negli ultimi 2 anni mi sono formato su tematiche di leadership sviluppando processi aziendali atti alla soddisfazione del team, al miglioramento della qualità e dell’efficienza produttiva. In quest’anno sono diventato CTO di Uqido e nello stesso tempo sono diventato massimo sostenitore degli One on One meeting, senza i quali non posso immaginare vita aziendale.",

L’obiettivo di questi meeting è quello di individuare gli ostacoli e le necessità che riguardano il team member e che possono essere smarcate per migliorare la vita aziendale. In questa sessione racconto come abbiamo introdotto questa pratica in azienda, che risultati ha portato e come abbiamo fatto a far entrare la cultura del feedback in azienda.",
