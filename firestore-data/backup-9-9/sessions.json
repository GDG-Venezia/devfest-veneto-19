We will then discover why native development, when viewed through the lens of cost-benefit ratio, is most of the time not the best tech-stack to choose if you're building a blitzscaling company from the group up â€“ and why cross-platform frameworks like Flutter are. Finally, we'll go through technical debt as well and what it means if you're raising a new funding round, as it is the natural downside of not going native since day 0.","presentation":"","complexity":"Beginner"},"202":{}}
